# Computaional Finance Sandbox

This is an ongoing personal project where I explore ideas in quantitative finance, risk modeling, and stochastic processes. Itâ€™s part codebase, part research journal.

Project contains:

- A LaTeX document where I talk about what I am doing
- A growing collection of experiments and models

This is not a polished project it's a living lab notebook intended for:

- Showcasing how I think and work
- Experimenting with novel or half-formed ideas
- Building towards more refined tools and insights over time
